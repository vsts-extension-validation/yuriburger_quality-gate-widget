4. Add and arrange one or more of the widgets on your dashboard.

### Known issue(s)

- You need to provide the full url for your SonarQube API. 
Example: `https://localhost/api/qualitygates/project_status?projectKey=`
- SonarQube does not support HTTPS natively, so you need to setup a simple proxy for this. If you do not do this, then your browser will block any mixed protocol content you might want to serve.
- SonarQube does not provide CORS support natively, so you need to setup the response header for this. For VSTS, the header could be: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin = https://<your account>.visualstudio.com`
